# Fashion_MNIST

## 1. Understand the dataset

`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct **drop-in replacement** for the original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

## 2. What I do in this projects
### a. Finding  the best Unsupervised Learning Algorithm by evaluating the best Silhouette score

* Applied KMeans clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models clustering
* Utilized Silhouette coefficient to determine which one is the best model

### b. Visualizing the dataset
* Applied demensionally reduction with PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP
* Evaluated based on visuall plots

## 3. Results.
* The best Clustering Model is KMeans with the number of cluster is 4

* The best dimensional reduction to visualize is UMAP with n_neighbors = 5 and min_dist = 0.3 or n_neighbors = 7 and min_dist = 1

***UMAP dimensionaly with n_neighbors = 5 and min_dist = 0.3***

## 4. Link to my work
Due to the large file, I can't upload my work on GitHub. However, I attach my work through google colab
